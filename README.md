🛒 Retail Uplift Analysis
This project is a simulation-based case study provided by Quantium (via Forage), where I analyzed the impact of a new store layout on customer purchasing behavior, specifically focusing on chip sales. Using uplift modeling and data-driven techniques, I identified the effectiveness of the layout change and provided strategic recommendations for business stakeholders.
